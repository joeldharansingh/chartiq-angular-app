/*************************************! DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THIS LIBRARY FILE!! !*************************************
* If you wish to overwrite default functionality, create a separate file with a copy of the methods you are overwriting *
* and load that file right after the library has been loaded, but before the chart engine is instantiated.              *
* Directly modifying library files will prevent upgrades and the ability for ChartIQ to support your solution.          *
